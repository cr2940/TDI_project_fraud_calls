The Data Incubator Project Proposal: Finding Fraudulent Calls

This is a repository for work that aims to develop a model which will detect fraudulent calls in America. This will be part of the capstone project with the Data Incubator. Most likely the algorithm will involve trees and perhaps neural network given the complex relationships between fraudulent call numbers, timings, geographic location involved. It will rely on constantly updated data from the FTC website.
